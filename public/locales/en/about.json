      "description": "The start of Sa gulita was the result of an unexpected twist of fate that was not in my plans. Although I had no intention of starting a business, inspiration suddenly struck when I came across a rental space. I immediately recognized it as the perfect place to provide people with a space where they could enjoy healthy eating. I started it at the age of 26, and my enthusiasm and excitement led me to take the reins and discover a passionate connection with food. As I researched and experimented, I evolved and formed a team. With the support of my partner, who became my business partner, we were able to create many new things together. We started making homemade ferments, fermented beverages, cheeses, and also made use of the produce from our own garden. Always with the intention of nourishing not only bodies but also souls."
